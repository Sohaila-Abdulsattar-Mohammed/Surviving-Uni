## Project Background
*Surviving Uni* is my final project for the **CS-UH 1001 Introduction to Computer Science** course at **New York University Abu Dhabi** during the **Fall 2022 semester**. The gameplay is inspired by the classic arcade game *Pink Panther Jewel Heist*.

## Game Overview
*Surviving Uni* is a fast-paced, pixel-style game developed in **Processing Python**. Players help the main character, Soha, navigate the academic challenges of university life by outrunning obstacles and collecting power-ups, all while managing time and resources.

The goal is to descend through 100 levels, representing the journey through university, while avoiding academic-related enemies and maintaining Soha's body fuel. Time is the greatest enemy, represented by a red beam that continuously chases Soha downward. The game ends if Sohaâ€™s body fuel depletes or if the red beam catches up.

## Game Mechanics
Players control Soha by using the left and right arrow keys to move her horizontally across the platforms. For more information on the details of the game, please refer to the image below:
